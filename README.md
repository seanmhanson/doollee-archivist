  <h2>FAQs</h2>

  <h3>What is Doollee?</h3>
  <p><a href="https://doollee.com" target="_blank">Doollee.com</a> is a massive online project spearheaded by <strong>Julian Oddy</strong> cataloging theatre plays that were written, adapted, or translated into English since the 1956 production of John Osborne's <em>Look Back in Anger</em> until 2021. Oddy spent his life curating this collection, and died in September 2022 at which time the website was maintained in tribute to his work and his person.</p>

  <h3>Why scrape and archive Doollee?</h3>

  <p>Doollee, while remaining online as a tribute, is no longer maintained. The site has accumulated usability issues over time from code written before XHTML/HTML5 standards, expired security certificates, 404s, and other bugs. At the same time, the value of the site and work is absolutely prodigous, often presenting significantly more information for younger and lesser known playwrights than other resources like wikipedia.</p>

  <p>Archiving this means:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>preserving Julian Oddy's work beyond a single source</li>
    <li>no longer requiring freinds and family to carry the burden of maintainance</li>
    <li>making this resource available more readily online</li>
    <li>allowing the curation of modern search for easier surfacing of plays and playwrights</li>
  </ul>
