  <b>7:84 Theatre Company (England) 1973-1984</b>: Scottish left-wing agitprop
  theatre group. The name comes from a statistic, published in The Economist in
  1966, that 7% of the population of the UK owned 84% of the country's wealth.
  The group was originally founded by playwright John McGrath, his wife
  Elizabeth MacLennan and her brother David MacLennan in 1971, and operated
  throughout Great Britain. In 1973, it split into 7:84 (England) and 7:84
  (Scotland). The English group folded in 1984, having lost its grant from the
  Arts Council of Great Britain.<br /><br /><b

  >: In 1973, it split into 7:84 (England) and 7:84 (Scotland). The English
  group folded in 1984, having lost its grant from the Arts Council of Great
  Britain. The Scottish group lost its funding from the Scottish Arts Council in
  2006, though Artistic Director Lorenzo Mele successfully secured funding for a
  further year from April 2007. He subsequently commissioned a series of four
  plays, Wound by Nicola McCartney, Eclipse by Haresh Sharma, A Time To Go by
  Selma Dimitrijevic, and Doch-An-Doris (A Parting Drink) by Linda McLean.
  Together, these short plays formed Re:Union, a production which toured
  Scotland in early 2007. This was followed in September 2007 by Raman Mundair's
  The Algebra of Freedom, which also toured extensively throughout Scotland.
  This production was directed by 7:84's Associate Director, Jo Ronan, and
  designed by David Sneddon. On 31 December 2008, the Scottish company ceased
  trading, citing "the changing funding structures in Scottish theatre.
