  Sarah Kane (3 February 1971  20 February 1999) was an English playwright. Her
  plays deal with themes of redemptive love, sexual desire, pain, torture  both
  physical and psychological  and death. They are characterised by a poetic
  intensity, pared-down language, exploration of theatrical form and, in her
  earlier work, the use of extreme and violent stage action. Kane herself, as
  well as scholars of her work, such as Graham Saunders, identify some of her
  inspirations as expressionist theatre and Jacobean tragedy. Critics, including
  Aleks Sierz, have seen her work as part of what Sierz calls the In-Yer-Face
  style of theatre, a form of drama which broke away from the conventions of
  naturalist theatre. Kane's published work consists of five plays, three
  mnonologues,one short film, Skin, and two newspaper articles for The Guardian.
